                    Hi, I'm Oluwatosin Thompson, a dedicated Software Engineer passionate about delivering top-notch products. With a background in Zoology, I ventured into software development, initially focusing on frontend work before diving into backend technologies.

                    <br>I love sharing my journey through technical articles and documenting my learning experiences. What sets me apart is my eagerness to tackle new challenges, always striving for excellence. I'm known for my teachable nature and ability to absorb knowledge quickly.

                    <br>In my current journey, I've mastered a range of technologies including Golang, React, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and more. I specialize in responsive design, domain-driven designs, and clean code principles.

                    <br>Beyond coding, I cherish connecting with people and spending quality time with family and friends. 

                    <br>Let's build exceptional solutions together!

                    I am a software engineer focused on the backend. I'm self-taught on both frontend and backend development but I think I would want a proper training on cloud engineering and I hope Altschool Africa is everything it says it is.<br> I have always been interested in cloud computing and I also think cloud computing is going to be a must for every backend engineer in the nearest future. <br> I want to learn more about cloud computing and how to deploy applications on the cloud and hopefully get a job offer that allows me to use both my backend skills and cloud skills at the same time.

                    I have worked on a couple of projects that required deploying applications on the cloud. <br> I have also worked on a project that required me to set up a CI/CD pipeline for a project. <br> I have also worked on a project that required me to set up a monitoring system for an application.

                    I transitioned into tech from a zoology background where I learnt how to write code in frontend languages and later transitioned into backend development. <br> One of the things that served as a motivation for me was the fact that I could build things that could be used by people all over the world. <br> Another thing that sets me apart is my ability to learn new things quickly and my ability to work with a team. <br> I am also a good communicator and I am always willing to learn new things. I have been described as a teachable person by my previous employers. <br> I intend to use the knowledge I gain from this program to build applications that can be used by people all over the world. <br> Continous learning is a part of my journey and I believe that this program will help me achieve my goals.
